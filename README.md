# Random Duty List
Suppose you have a list of 200 people and you want to assign 120 people of these 200 people daily. What RDL does is assign those 120 people randomley from the list of 200 people and after those 200 people are completed the list is shuffled and then duties are assigned.

This software is made for Chndigarh police (India). So, they had like 20 stations in Chandigarh and they had to assign people to these stations. They had three different ranks of officials to be allocated to each of the station. Here we take those different ranks of officers to be CategoryA, CategoryB, CategoryC and we have to allocate say 2 poeple from CategoryA, 4 from CategoryB and 2 poeple from CategoryC at each station. So we would have 8 poeple at each station. Now we have a list of the police officials and we want to allocate the duties randomely of the officials to each station with the same pattern not being repeated again.
